This is a senior design project by me, Luis Silva. It is an app that allows users to track their fitness activity.
Given the data and the activity engaged in, inputed by the user, the app will recommend products. Therefore it has E-Commerce capabilities.
The app was developed using JS and Expo. It is really basic as it is just a prototype for a school project.
The app is currently limited to the ability of imputing running data, and recives recommendations from my shopify store that i created for this project.
The app also has the ability to search. But again solely from my makeshift shopify store.
